INTRODUCTION 

"Online Restaurant Management System"  This system is developed to automate day to day activity of a restaurant. Restaurant is a kind of business that serves people all over world with ready made food. This system is developed to provide service facility to restaurant and also to the customer. This restaurant management system can be used by employees in a restaurant to handle the clients, their orders and can help them easily  place orders. The services that are provided is food ordering and reservation table management by the customer through the system online, customer information management and  menu information management and report. The restaurant menu is organized by categories (meals, soups, salads, entrees, sides and drinks) of menu items. 
Main objective build the system this is to provide ordering to the customer. Each menu item has a name, price and associated recipe. A recipe for a menu item has a chef,preparation instruction sand associated ingredients. With this system online, ordering and reservation management will become easier and systematic to replace traditional system where are still using paper.Online Restaurant management system is the system for manage the restaurant business. After  the customer entry into the hotel he can access the menu page with the items listed according to the desired time. 
The main point of developing this system is to help restaurant administrator manage the restaurant business and help customer for ordering . In proposed system user can search for a menu according to his choice i.e. according to price range and category of food and later he can order a meal.

The project is developing because; many restaurants have a lot difficult to manage the business such as customer ordering and reservation table. If the customer book an order and later wants to cancel the order, he is permitted to do this only within a specific time period. By using manual customer ordering is difficult to waiter keep the correct customer information and maybe loss the customer information. The customer is also given with the facility to view the status of the order and if the order is ready then he can go and get it.

So, online restaurant management system will develop to help the restaurant administrator to manage restaurant management and for customer make their online ordering and reservation table. At Management side, initially the staff member has to login, and according to his designation the privileges are set. Other than that, this project is to upgrade the manual system and make the business easily to access and systematic. If the staff member is a cook, then he is allowed to edit only the order items status, indicating which menu items he has prepared.


Besides, the restaurant waiter information also by manual system kept use paper and this is difficult for restaurant administrator to find waiter information, probability missing the paper and difficult to arrange the schedule. Initial problem is that the customer has to get connected over the phone, it would be harder if the restaurant is very popular and busy. Sometimes, waiter information and customer information is important to restaurant administrator for reference in the future. The chances of committing mistakes at the restaurant side in providing a menu list for a specific time would be more.
Furthermore, restaurant side needs management in the section menu. This is the important to restaurant waiter to manage the menu. As customer wonâ€™t have the menu list with him, it would be harder for him to remember the entire list (with price as well...!) and come to a decision, i.e. customer is provided with less time to make decision.Besides this section is for customer viewer the menu that restaurant prepared and make their ordering.
There might be some communication problems or sometimes language might be a barrier. As a result, the current system (manual system) is not effective and efficient to use anymore. As entire booking has to be done manually at the restaurant end, the chances of occurrence of mistakes is high as well. The current system cannot save, manage and monitor the restaurant waiter information, menu information, customer ordering information and generate report well. Even assigning orders (or some menu from the order) to a specific cook can be cumbersome if it is done parallel with the bookings of the order.

User of the system
customer, administrator
Customer
This user will register to be a member to use the online system of this online restaurant management system. This online ordering divided into two type of customer; it is customer dine-in ordering and takeaway ordering. For dine in ordering, customer will view menu, make online ordering and make a reservation table. This system allows customer to place an order or allow him to cancel the book order.  But takeaway ordering, customer can view menu and online ordering without reservation table. During login, the costumer has to enter the time of delivery, and the menu items will appear accordingly. As availability of items differ from time to time. After customer make online ordering, customer can take ordering the date that customer was choose during make online ordering. Customers can search menu according to price range and the category as well, Event though, customer must confirm online ordering with restaurant three days before customer take the ordering for dine-in customer and for take-away customer will be confirm one hour before it whether by email or phone. customer can create his new account or he can edit his personal information from the existing account.

Administrator 
Administrator or manager is the person who will manage the entire system. he is allowed to reassign the cook according to his priority, he can edit the menu information such as its price, items available currently, etc. This type of user will also do maintenance and control the application of this system. A manager can reassign the cook for a specific order or an item. Administrator takes a responsibility to register new customer, register new waiter, register new menu into database. A manager can edit/create some or whole part of the menu record on daily basis. That is by changing the menu items, prices, description, etc.
